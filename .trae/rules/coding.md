Rule: Coding
=============

Goal
----
Implement the approved design with production-quality, maintainable code.

Guidelines
----------
1. Follow project coding standards (naming, formatting, lint rules, commit style).
2. Implement only the functions/classes specified in the Design Specâ€”no feature creep.
3. Write self-documenting code; add comments only for non-obvious logic or decisions.
4. Keep functions small and pure where possible; favour composition over inheritance.
5. Add or update automated tests; ensure the entire test suite passes locally/CI.
6. Deliverable: a clean pull-request with descriptive commits, passing CI, ready for review.
