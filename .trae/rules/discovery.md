Rule: Discovery
================

Goal
----
Understand the problem space and explore potential solutions before any design or coding begins.

Guidelines
----------

1. Clarify the business goal, constraints, and success criteria in plain Chinese.
2. Read existing code and documentation to identify reusable components and gaps.
3. Brain-storm at least two viable technical approaches and list pros / cons / risks for each.
4. Surface unknowns, external dependencies, or stakeholder questions that require follow-up.
5. Deliverable: a concise **Discovery Note** summarising requirements, explored options, open questions, and next actions.
6. No need any implementation.
7. Before discovery, please read README.md file which located at root folder to understand the project structure.
8. If you are not sure, you can confirm with me.
