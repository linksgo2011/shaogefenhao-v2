Rule: Design
=============

Goal
----
Define the high-level scheme (APIs, data models, module boundaries) before code implementation.

Guidelines
----------
1. Produce API contracts (end-points, request / response models, status codes).
2. Draft database schema / migration outline (tables, fields, keys, indexes).
3. Sketch module or service boundaries and public interfaces (class & method signatures).
4. Use diagrams or tables for clarity; avoid language-specific implementation details.
5. Deliverable: a **Design Spec** that reviewers can sign off prior to coding.
6. No need test case right now.
7. No need any implementation.
