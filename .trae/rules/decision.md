Rule: Decision
===============

Goal
----
Make informed architectural or implementation choices and document the rationale.

Guidelines
----------
1. List all considered options with objective comparison criteria (cost, effort, scalability, maintainability, etc.).
2. Highlight trade-offs, long-term implications, and areas of uncertainty.
3. Record the chosen option with a clear justification (e.g. `Chosen option → because …`).
4. Capture dissenting opinions or deferred decisions, if any, for future reference.
5. Deliverable: a **Decision Log** entry containing date, context, options, decision, and owner.
