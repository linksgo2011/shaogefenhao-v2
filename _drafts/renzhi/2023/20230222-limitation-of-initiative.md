People always get works done in the least strength way.

Insights here：

1. Shouldn't give expectation too much for subordinates .
2. Have to give definition of done(DoD) for any works which dispatched to other people otherwise probably the result is not satisfied.
3. Always consider plan B in case some unexpected event happened and give buffer for time over consuming.
