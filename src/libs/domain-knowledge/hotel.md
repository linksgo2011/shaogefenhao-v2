## Hotel Domain Knowledge

- Property Management Systems (PMS): PMS is the central nervous system of a hotel's operations. It handles reservations, check-ins, check-outs, billing, room assignments, and more. Understanding how PMS works and its integration with other systems is crucial for IT system design.
- Online Booking Systems: These systems allow guests to make reservations through the hotel's website or third-party booking platforms. Integrating online booking systems with the PMS ensures seamless reservation management and availability updates.
- Point of Sale (POS) Systems: POS systems handle transactions at various hotel outlets like restaurants, bars, and gift shops. Integration with PMS and inventory management systems is essential for tracking revenue, managing inventory, and generating reports.
- Channel Management: Hotels often distribute their inventory across multiple online travel agencies (OTAs) and other distribution channels. Channel management systems synchronize room availability and rates across these channels to maximize bookings and minimize overbooking.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): CRM systems help hotels manage guest information, preferences, and interactions. Personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and guest feedback management rely on CRM data.
- Revenue Management Systems (RMS): RMS use data analytics to optimize room rates and maximize revenue. Integrating RMS with PMS and channel management systems enables dynamic pricing based on demand and market conditions.
- Security and Compliance: IT systems in hotels must comply with industry standards for data security (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - PCI DSS) and guest privacy (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR).
- Back-office Systems: These include accounting software, payroll systems, and HR management tools essential for administrative tasks and financial management.
- Infrastructure and Connectivity: Reliable network infrastructure, high-speed internet access, and robust cybersecurity measures are critical to support the seamless operation of hotel IT systems.
